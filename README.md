# Git Courseware

## Introduction

This repository is part of a introduction course to Git and GitHub, working mostly with YAML files. The purpose is to be a point of reference more readily available than a presentation. Feel free to fork or clone this repository and make it personal, if you like.

## Prerequisites

Git must be installed locally, if you are not only using *Codespaces*. For *Codespaces*, Git is already installed.

- For Windows, the latest version of Git can be downloaded from [this location][git-win].
- Linux, BSD and Mac users may already have it installed. If not, follow your distro guidelines for installing it.
- For Mac, you can also use this [guide][xcode] for installing using Xcode.
  - Homebrew is also an option

## Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

An IDE like Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is not strictly necessary, and your own preference of Notepad, GNOME Text Editor, TextEdit, Notepad++ and nano will take you far. Provided you have Git installed, and know your Git commands from the terminal of your preference.

Where an IDE like VSCode, VIM and Emacs help you, are with the Language Servers available for your development language of choice: allowing for auto-completion, error checking, jump-to-defintion and all that good stuff. IDEs also provide extensions you can use to tailor your own development flow, adding linters, prettifiers, helpers, code analysis and [pets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tonybaloney.vscode-pets).

In this course we will have a look at Visual Studio Code, as that is one of the most distributed IDEs currently around.

### Setting up Visual Studio Code

VS Code can be installed by downloading it from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/). If you cannot download due to restrictions by your corporate entity, they might have a developer image where this is pre-installed, or it may be available using a Software Center.

If you are using GitHub, you can also opt to using Visual Studio Code as the IDE in GitHub Codespaces, by defining "Visual Studio Code for the Web" as Editor preference in your [GitHub Settings][codespace-settings].

#### Connecting your GitHub user to Visual Studio Code

When running a GitHub Codespace, your GitHub user will be set up. All you have to do is press the *Person* icon in the lower left corner, and enable *Settings sync*. Provided you have enabled the setting in the [GitHub Settings][codespace-settings] under *Settings Sync*.

For VSCode installed, just click the *Person* icon in the lower left corner, and log in using your GitHub account.

Doing this gives you the opportunity to auto install, and setup VSCode using the same extensions and settings across different environments: like at work, at home and in, and across, GitHub Codespaces.

Once logged in, ensure that "Settings Sync is On" using the *Person* icon.

#### Add your extensions

When working with YAML files, or indeed this repository, there are a few extensions I would highly recommend:

| Extension | Short description | Link |
| - | - | - |
| EditorConfig | Helps to maintain consistent coding styles cross developers. Github has native support for it, and it can be added as an extension for VS Code. Requires a `.editorconfig` file repositories in order to work. | [extension][editorconf]Â |
| YAML | The YAML linter from Red Hat, includes support for Kubernetes syntax | [extension][yaml] |
| Linter | Supports many linters, including [*yamllint*][yamllint]. Requires a `.yamllint` file in your repository to override default settings globally. | [extension][linter] |

### Closing off the IDE setup

This is just to get you started. There are maaaany more extensions that may serve you well in the future, but I'll leave it up to you to find [them][vscode-pets].

At the root of this repository, you will find examples for both `.editorconfig` and `.yamllint` overrides. These files only work within the context they are loaded, so for files outside of this repository, they will have no effect. You should, therefore, consider adding these files to all repositories, to ensure that the developer experience will be same, cross the repositories you connect with.

Please note that these files can be expanded and changed, fitting to your needs.

By following the steps above, you should be off to a good start towards dominating the world of YAML files, and beyond....

## Working with Git/GitHub

### Creating a new repository

The easiest way to create a new repository at GitHub, is to make use of the [GitHub Dashboard][github-dashboard]. At the top left corner, you are presented with a green *New* button, right next to "Top Repositories". Press that button.

Select a repository template if applicable. Note that a selecting a template automatically switches the *Owner* to the origin of that template.

Use the drop down button for *Owner* to select which user or organization the repository should be created in, and provide a fitting name for the repository. The repository name needs to be unique within the *Owner* you have selected.

A description for the repository can be provided now, however - it is optional, and you can add one later.

Make a selection of whether the repository should be public or private. Follow your organization guidelines, if you are allowed to create new repositories. For a repository you own yourself, you are allowed to define it as you wish. The main difference is that there are limitations to which additional GitHub benefits you can make use of, when on a Free account. For public repositories, there are limits - but most additional benefits can be made use of.

You can add a README file to get you going, add a `.gitignore` file to help you avoid adding helper files to your repository, and you can choose to add a license.

By pressing the *Create repository* button, the repository is created.

From this point, you should really go to the *Settings* button of your repository, and define what you might be allowed - or not allowed to do.

### Cloning your repository

In case you work on your local computer, you need to clone your repository locally, before you can start working on it. Open your favorite terminal (be it Powershell, CMD or a unix terminal).

Navigate to a repository you will work with in GitHub, and select the *<> Code* button. Select HTTPS, SSH or GitHub CLI under *Clone* and copy the path.

Open your terminal, and navigate to where you want to store your repository locally. Replace `url-copied-from-button` with the clone path copied from the *<> Code* button.

```sh
cd /navigate/to/your/desired/folder/src

git clone url-copied-from-button
```

> ***DO NOT*** use a folder inside Onedrive, Google Drive, iCloud, Dropbox or something to that effect, to store repositories. They ***will*** eventually break the local repository.

### Branches

Branches in Git are cheap. They reference the repository branch you branched off of (usually main or master) at a specific point in time, referenced by a commit SHA.

When you want to make a change to a repository, it is best practice to start the process by creating a new branch from the branch you want your changes to be merged to. Usually, this is the main branch.

There are several ways to create a branch.

#### Branching in GitHub

The easiest way to branch in GitHub is to go to the main page of the repository, and click the *branch* shortcut right next to the branch selector. You are now placed in a url like so: `https://github.com/<organization>/<repository>/branches`. You can also press the drop down button for branches, and select *View all branches*. This takes you to the same place.

Select the "New branch" button, and provid a name.

> Tip: name the branch something that resembles what you want to achieve. Like `feat/add_more_pizzas`, or `bug/eliminate_rats_in_the_cheese`. Naming branches *may* be part of a naming standard in your organization. In such cases, refer to these standards for naming.

Once the branch name has been set, use the drop down button for *Source* to select what you are branching off of. Usually, this should be **main**.

By clicking on your newly created branch, your are taken to that branch code space.

Use the drop down button for branches to switch between active branches.

> Tip: By pressing the *<> Code* button and selecting *Codespaces*, you can create a new codespace with your current branch active.

#### Branching locally using VSCode

Open VSCode, select *File* and *Open folder*. Navigate to where the repository has been cloned locally. Select the repository folder, and press *Open*. In its Explorer activity section, you should now see all files associated with that repository only.

Go to the *Source Control* activity and press the *View and More Actions...* button, and make sure *Branches* is ticked. You should see it as a collapsed section of the SOURCE CONTROL section. Expand it.

When hovering the BRANCHES section, you will see a +-symbol. Press that symbol, which will provide a popup dialogue at the top of your VSCode window.

Enter the branch name. Follow your organization guidelines for naming it that exists, else provide a good name that describes what you want to achieve. Press *Enter* when done.

You can now select "Create Branch" or "Create Branch and Switch". You should select the "Create Branch and Switch" in order to be able to start working right away.

Use the "Switch to Another Branch..." button right next to the +-symbol in BRANCHES to switch between branches.

> Please note that this will create a branch from your current active branch. If that is not main, you need to switch branches first by using the "Switch to Another Branch..." shortcut in the same BRANCHES section.

##### Alternative way to branch in VSCode

An alternative way to create a branch is to use the shortcuts Shift+Ctrl+P in order to active the *Command palette*. Start typing "git create", and select "Git: Create branch..." or "Git: Create branch from...".

- "Git: Create branch..." creates a branch from your current active branch. If the active branch is not main, you might have to switch branches first.
- "Git: Create branch from..." provides an ability to select which branch to branch from.

> Tip: If selecting "Create branch from ..." you get a list of possible branches to choose from.
> *main* will be your local main. *origin/main* represents the remote repository in GitHub.

#### Branching locally using Git commands

In your terminal (can be the terminal in VSCode), make sure you are navigated into the correct repository.

First of all, make sure you are in the branch you want to branch off of, like *main*. Also ensure that your local *main* is up to date with the remote *origin/main*. You can do this by issuing the following commands

```sh
git checkout main # This ensures that your active branch is *main*
git fetch # This fetches all remote changes, but does not pull them
git pull # This pulls all changes from the remote repository
```

##### Create new branch without switching

Create a new branch from updated *main*, but do not switch to it:

```sh
git branch newbranchname
```

You can also create a new branch from a different branch than your currently active one, issuing the following command:

```sh
git branch newbranchname -t origin/main
```

This tells git to create a new branch named *newbranchname* from the branch available remotely at *origin/main*.

##### Switch to a different branch

Issue this command to switch to the new branch:

```sh
git checkout newbranchname
```

> Tip: You can switch between your two latest checkouts (*main* and your current *newbranchname*) by issuing the following command:
>
> ```sh
> git checkout -
> ```
>
> The `-` represents the previous branch name you used. Much the same way `cd` works.

##### Create and switch to a new branch

In order to create a new branch, and switch to it automatically, you can instead issue the following command:

```sh
git checkout -b newbranchname
```

The `-b` option is used to create a branch with the name that follows immediately after the `-b`.

You can also create a branch from a different branch than your currently active branch the same way, by issuing the following command:

```sh
git checkout -b newbranchname -t origin/main
```

This tells git to create a new branch named *newbranchname* from the branch available remotely at *origin/main*.

### Git Add

No changes made to a branch is part of the local branch before the changes has been added to the "tracker". You will see that files are modified (`M`) from what the branch knows, or that a file is not yet part of the branch tracker yet (`U`), but these changes are not yet part of the source control. In order to add any changes made, you need to put any new files and/or any changes to existing files into a staging area. This is performed by providing the `git add` command.

You can see the status of individual files in a terminal by issuing the command:

```sh
git status
```

#### Add changes in GitHub

Changes made directly in GitHub are added and commited at the moment you press "Commit changes...".

#### Add changes in VSCode

In VSCode, use the +-symbol next to files under *Changes* in *SOURCE CONTROL*. This will move them into the staging area.

#### Add changes using terminal

In a terminal, never use the `git add .` command. It will add all changes, in all files, also files that have not been previously tracked. This is the most common way of introducing items in your repository that your REALLY do not want to be there. Examples include passwords, secrets, or files containing things you are just trying out.

##### Add new files using terminal

New files can be added in a chain, separated by a space in your add command. You can do one file, or many files at the same time. The command is:

```sh
git add file1.ext file2.ext Examples/file3.ext
```

##### Add changes to tracked files using terminal

You can add changes to already tracked files using the command above, but you also have a nice way of reviewing the changes you have made by issuing the following command:

```sh
git add -p
```

Now you can go through the changes, review them in and press `y` to include them, `n` to not include, `a` to include all changes in that file or `q` to stop. Plus a ton more options.

### Git Stash

It may very well be that you have made changes that you do not want to be part of a commit, or you need to change branches and have to either commit or stash your current changes in order to do so.

The `git stash` command stashes all your changes temporarily, until you either `clear` the stash, or `pop` the stash.

- `git stash clear` will remove what has been stashed, and it will not be recoverable.
- `git stash pop` will reapply the changes you previously stashed to the current active branch, and then clear the same changes from the stash.

#### Stash changes in GitHub

As far as I know, this is not possible. You have already commited your changes.

#### Stash changes in VSCode

First add all files that should be commited. Commit those changes. Then right click the "Changes" area, and select select "Stash All Changes". Change the stash message, or press *Enter* to use the one suggested.

> You can also stash individual files, it is just more cumbersome.

To pop the stash, you will find the current stash under *STASHES*. Select the *Apply Stash* button, and choose to *Pop* the stash.

#### Stash changes using the terminal

The easiest way is to add and commit the changes you need first. Then you can simply issue the command:

```sh
git stash
```

To stash all changes to tracked files, or:

```sh
git stash --include-untracked
```

to also include files that have not yet been added to the source control tracker.

You can, as well stash files indivdually by using

```sh
git stash file1.ext file2.ext Example/file3.ext
```

To recover the changes using terminal on your current active branch, you can issue the command:

```sh
git stash pop
```

This will reapply all the changes you previously stashed.

> Issuing the command below, will instead clear the stash. You will not be able to recover these changes again.
>
> ```sh
> git stash clear
> ```

### Remove files from branch

Files that are part of the source control tracker can also be removed. You can just delete the file outright, but then you need to add and commit that to the staging area by using Add afterwards. If you are prepared to use the terminal, there is a much more efficient way of removing individual files - or entire folders with content.

#### Remove files using GitHub

Select the file you want to delete, and press the *...*-button on the top row. Select *Delete file*.

#### Remove files using VSCode

First, delete the file from the *Explorer* activity. Then go to the *SOURCE CONTROL* activity and select the +-symbol next to the file (should be represented with strikethrough and `D`), and press the +-symbol to stage the file deletion.

#### Remove files and folders using the terminal

In the terminal, you can issue the `git rm` command. This removes and stages the removal immediately.

For individual files:

```sh
git rm file1.ext file2.ext Example/file3.ext
```

If you need to remove an entire folder, you can do this by:

```sh
git rm foldername -rf
```

The `-r` option makes it recursive, deleting everything in the folder you have stated. The `-f` option forces it to remove files, even recursively.

### Commit changes

All changes in staging will be part of the same commit. If you want to avoid certain changes inside a commit, you should not add those changes to the staging area yet. Either stash the remaining changes, or leave them alone for now.

#### Commit in GitHub

Commit is made at the same time any file is changed and saved, as you need to "Commit changes..." to save them. Remember to add a proper commit message.

#### Commit in VSCode
